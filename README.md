Opera VPN via Tor

This is an useability tool for Tor. Please keep quiet about it, posting on
social media about will just ruin it for everyone in short order.

I and few others need it to access the internet via Tor, which has serious
useability problems without an out-proxy.

Also note that Tor project discourages chained exit proxies. Perhaps when
misguided ideas like "IP scoring" disappear some day, but until then, here we
are.
